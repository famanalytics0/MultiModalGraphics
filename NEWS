NEWS for the MultimodalGraphics package

Changes in version 0.99.0 (2024-04-20)
--------------------------------------

* Submitted to Bioconductor.

* Added new classes `InformativeHeatmap`, `MultifeatureGrid`, and `ClearScatterplot` for advanced data visualization techniques.

* Included functions for intuitive visualization of multimodal datasets, allowing users to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies across diverse data sources.

* Implemented object-oriented programming with S4 classes for robust, extensible, and modular design.

* Integrated with ggplot2 for customizable scatter plots and ComplexHeatmap for advanced heatmap representations.

* Provided a suite of annotation options including mathematical symbols, significant values, and statistical modelling outputs.

* Enabled user customization of graphical grids for complex information visualization.

* Facilitated interactive selection and subset extraction when visualizations are rendered on interactive devices like Shiny or X11.

* Accommodated large multimodal datasets while maintaining clarity and interpretability.

* Made the source code and example datasets available on GitHub and documentation available through the Bioconductor project.
