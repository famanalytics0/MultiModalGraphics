Description: The MultimodalGraphics R package provides rich functionalities for combining different data types 
            into an integrative visual representation. This package facilitates the creation of intuitive visualization 
            that merge multiple streams of data into a single coherent graphic. 
            Features of MultimodalGraphics include: (i) flexible support for inclusion of statistical outputs 
            such as error margins, standard deviations, p-values or any other statistical modelling outputs; 
            (ii) the ability to add any symbol, text, image, special character or any object at any site of the drawing canvas; 
            (iii) user-customization of the graphical grids for more advanced visualization of complex information; 
            (iv) interactive selection on different graphical presentations to obtain subset of rows and columns 
            if the visualizations are rendered on an interactive device (e.g. shiny, X11) and 
            (v) the ability to add more customized graphics after main graphics objects are created. 
            MultimodalGraphics is designed to be modularized, and its flexibility and extensibility enables 
            a comprehensible presentation of multimodal and multidimensional datasets.
            We demonstrate the utility of MultimodalGraphics to easily reveal patterns and correlations 
            among multiple sources of information with three different sets of actual multimodal datasets.
